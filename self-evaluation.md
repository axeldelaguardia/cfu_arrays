1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- Feeling pretty confident. Understanding the material very well.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Everything in the array lesson has been clear. I do think I'm going to practice actually using the array methods to get a feel for them. From the Ruby Docs, I can see what they do but find it much easier to understand them when actually using them in VS Code or irb.
1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I don't believe I have any questions on the lessons but I am curious is there are specific methods that are most commonly used in the real world. It's nice that we can always reference methods in the Ruby Docs, seems like there's too many to remember!
